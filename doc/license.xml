Granted Rights
</h3>
<p> 1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this
license.  
Whole or partial distribution or use of the Software
in any form or way signifies acceptance of this license.

<p> 2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided
that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright,
trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
of the Software, is distributed under this license.

<p> 3. You may make modifications to the Software's
source code and distribute your
modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:
<p> <blockquote>
a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
the Software.
<p> b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification
in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain
available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of
the initial developer.
<p> c. The machine-executable (compiled) parts of the Software shall not
be modified.
</blockquote>
<p> 4. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
analyze and modify application programs, libraries, or other
software legally developed by you or by others
provided that when these items are distributed in any form
you satisfy following requirements:
<p> <blockquote>
a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
these items are also able to receive and use the complete
machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
beyond the costs of data transfer.
<p> b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
<p> c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
then you must supply one.
</blockquote>
<p> 5. You acknowledge and accept the fact that the Software may contain
technical measures to enforce parts of this license
(such as providing the public with a browsable version of the code you are
analyzing, and the transmission of workspace-related data)
and agree not to interfere with these measures.

Limitations of Liability
</h3>
<p> In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable
for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost
revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or
consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility
of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides
otherwise.
