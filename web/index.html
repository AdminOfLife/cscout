<em>CScout</em> is a source code analyzer and refactoring browser for
collections of C programs.
It can process workspaces of multiple projects (we define a project
as a collection of C source files that are linked together)
mapping the complexity introduced
by the C preprocessor back into the original C source code files.
<em>CScout</em> takes advantage of modern hardware advances (fast processors
and large memory capacities) to analyze C source code beyond the level
of detail and accuracy provided by  current compilers, linkers, and
other source code analyzers.
The analysis CScout performs takes into account the identifier scopes
introduced by the C preprocessor and the C language proper scopes and
namespaces.
After the source code analysis <em>CScout</em> can
<ul>
<li>perform accurate cross project identifier renames,</li>
<li>process sophisticated queries on identifiers, files, and functions,</li>
<li>locate unused or wrongly-scoped identifiers,</li>
<li>identify header files that don't need to be included, and</li>
<li>create call graphs spanning both C functions and function-like macros.</li>
</ul>
<em>CScout</em> has already been applied on projects ranging from
tens of thousands of lines,
like the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache web server</a>, to millions of
lines, like the <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensing/researchkernel.mspx">Windows Research</a> kernels.
With <em>CScout</em> you can make your hardware really work for its money.
For example, processing the 2.6.11 Linux kernel (4.2 million lines of code)
requires 4052MB of RAM and 4.7 hours of processing on a
dual-CPU 2.2MHz AMD Opteron computer.
After the processing <em>CScout</em> holds details on 1.1 million identifiers and 89 thousand
functions and function-like macros.
