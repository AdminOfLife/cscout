<em>CScout</em> is distributed in source code form,
which is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/cscout">GitHub</a>.
CScout has been compiled and tested on GNU/Linux
(Debian jessie, and Amazon Linux 2015.09),
Apple OS X (El Capitan), FreeBSD (11.0), and Cygwin. In order to
build and use CScout you need a Unix (like) system
with a modern C++ compiler and Perl.
To test CScout you also need to be able to run Java from the command line,
because tests use the HSQLDB database.
To run CScout you also need to have the
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> <em>dot</em> command in
your executable file path.
<ul>
	</li>To build, run <code>make</code>.</li>
	</li>To build and test, run <code>make test</code>.</li>
	</li>To install, run <code>sudo make install</code>.</li>
</ul>

To see how <em>CScout</em> can dump a workspace
in an SQL database you can download compressed database
dumps of the <em>CScout</em>-processed "one true <em>awk</em>" source code in
<a href="awk-mysql.sql.gz">MySQL</a>,
<a href="awk-postgres.sql.gz">PostgreSQL</a>, and
<a href="awk-hsqldb.sql.gz">HSQLDB</a> formats.
