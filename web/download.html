<em>CScout</em> is distributed in source code form,
which is hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/cscout">GitHub</a>.
CScout has been compiled and tested on GNU/Linux
(Debian jessie, and Amazon Linux 2015.09),
Apple OS X (El Capitan), FreeBSD (11.0), and Cygwin. In order to
build and use CScout you need a Unix (like) system
with a modern C++ compiler, GNU make, and Perl.
To test CScout you need to be able to run Java from the command line,
because tests use the HSQLDB database.
To view CScout's diagrams you must have the
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> <em>dot</em> command in
your executable file path.
<ul>
	<li>To build, run <code>make</code>.</li>
	<li>To build and test, run <code>make test</code>.</li>
	<li>To install (typically after building and testing),
	run <code>sudo make install</code>.</li>
	<li>To see CScout in action run <code>make example</code>.</li>
</ul>
You can find complete installation and setup instructions

in an SQL database you can download compressed database
dumps of the <em>CScout</em>-processed "one true <em>awk</em>" source code in
