Borland configuration file
Solaris compilation
experiment with hashmap performance

ceescape (swill) front end:

Allow interruptions in id queries

lex preprocessor / hooks
#pragma sync "filename" offset
#pragma nosync (default. Input is parsed, but unify is a null op)

C99 extensions

Convert color to cgi/command-line

Convert the _asm handling into generic handlers for excluding line and
block-based compiler extensions via compiler-specific preprocess-specific preprocessor defs.

Create Java-based front end
Make color conform with the other programs

Add isfunction identifier property
Add ispointer identifier property

Create separate database table with the newlines

Optimize (hash for map)
Create editor


I will take the opportunity to comment on the product. You may scrap
those comments or use them to improve CScout if you like:
1) An installer will make CScout more acceptable to Windows users;
3) I find it curious that entries in "Change history" are undated;
4) I think it would be an an improvement to allow cswc project | cscout
and would like a control to cause a browser to open automatically in
Windows.
5) I had to edit cswc to correct the directory to pick up perl.
7) My comments on the generated html are obviously first impressions:
a) I would like to see context information such as date and command in
"CScout Main Page".
b) Rearrange that page so it renders on 1 screen.
c) I think you should define many of the terms used in the html.
Examples: "Comment characters" - characters in comments; "line
comments"; "block comments"; "lines" - before or after processing \
"Number of" seems redundant.
8) I find the (grammatical) future tense jibs (deliberate nautical pun)
with me in technical documents because it mixes badly with the present
tense. Example: I suggest you use "lists" rather than "will list" in
'The "All files" link will list all the project's files, including
source files, and directly and indirectly included files. You can
use...'
9) I think the html can be optimised so that links which produce no
results are not made or are rendered in a different way. Example: I have
no "Writable .c Files Without Any Statments". (sic in result!)
2) "syntax error" should show current and next symbols.

include command in cswc
