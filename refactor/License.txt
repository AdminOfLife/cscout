CScout Source Code Evaluation License

This license governs use of the accompanying software, and your use
of the software constitutes acceptance of this license.  Your license
rights below are subject to the restrictions in the license, and are
available to you only so long as you remain eligible due to your status
under which they were provided to you.

You may use the source code as an aid for evaluating CScout and
understanding CScout's operation within your institution, including making
a reasonable number of copies.  Reading the code, tracing its operation,
looking at the context of error messages, and enabling debug points are
examples of legitimate uses.

You may not use or distribute this software or any derivative works in
any form and for any purpose other than those explicitly allowed above.
Examples of restricted uses would be compiling the source code, licensing,
leasing, or selling the software, or distributing the software to third
parties outside your institution.  If you wish to commercialize your
work that builds on the software or take part in research with industrial
partners, you need to acquire a commercial license.

You may not grant rights to the software or derivative works that are
broader than those provided by this license. For example, you may not
distribute modifications of the software under terms that would permit
commercial use, or under terms that purport to require the software or
derivative works to be sublicensed to others.

You may use any information in intangible form that you remember after
accessing the software. However, this right does not grant you a license
to any of the author's copyrights or patents for anything you might
create using such information.

In return for the license rights above, you must agree to these
obligations:

1.  You will not remove any copyright or other notices from the software,
nor reverse engineer or decompile binary portions of the software,
unless your laws give you the right to do so despite this restriction.

2.  You will include a verbatim copy of this license if you distribute
the software in any form.

3.  If you distribute derivative works of the software in source code
form you will do so only under this license.

4.  If you have modified the software or created derivative works,
and distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause
the modified files to carry prominent notices describing your changes
and the date of the changes, so that recipients know that they are not
receiving the original software.

5.  THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY
OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER
YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

6.  THE AUTHOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE
OR THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT THE LAW PERMITS, NO MATTER WHAT
LEGAL THEORY IT IS BASED ON. YOU MUST PASS THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.

7.  If you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to the
software or anyone's use of the software, your license to the software
ends immediately.

8.  You will not use the software to aid the development of any software
programs that are designed to: (a) harm or intentionally interfere with
the operation of a computer system including any data or information
stored on such computer system; and/or (b) surreptitiously gain or
maintain high level access to a computer system, self-propagate, and/or
execute in a manner that prevents detection, including but not limited
to, so-called "rootkit" software programs, viruses, or worms; and/or
(c) interfere with the program's licensing operations.

9.  Your rights under the license end immediately if you breach it in
any way.

10. The author reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in
this license.
