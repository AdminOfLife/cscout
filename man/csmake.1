.SH NAME
csmake \- CScout make
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcsmake\fP
[\fImake(1) options\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcsmake\fP is a wrapper around \fImake\fP and typical C compilation
commands.
When invoked instead of \fImake\fP on a clean (unbuilt) system,
it will build the system in the same way as \fImake\fP.
As a side-effect it will monitor the invocations of
\fIcc(1)\fP,
\fIgcc(1)\fP,
\fIar(1)\fP,
\fIld(1)\fP, and
\fImv(1)\fP commands and record their environment and arguments.
With those data it will generate a \fICScout\fP project specification
that can be used to process the project that was compiled.
The project specification is saved into a file named \fImake.cs\fP.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following commands are often the only ones required to process
a typical C project.
.PP
.DS
.ft C
.nf
make clean
csmake
cscout make.cs
.ft P
.fi
